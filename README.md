Description

A suite of jasmine tests that test the functionality of different features in an app provided by Udacity. The app provided by udacity is a working app that loads multiple feeds using Google Feed Reader API. The tests included range from testing whether or not there are valid urls for our feed reader to load to testing that the content of the page changes once a new feed is loaded.
